## Introduction

For this demo we will be expanding the project to be able to generate a github action that will build and deploy the site to IPFS.
And some other improvements.

## List Sites

First lets remember the sites we have created so far. For this we have introduced the `list` command.

```bash copy
> fleek sites list
WARN! Fleek CLI is in beta, use it at your own discretion
id                         name            
-------------------------------------------
cldach9r10000l508g2sqo3c2  fleek-demos     
cldbsgk7b0000ms08fl9ski7h  fleek-demo-2    
cldcy9ou30000md081svcz9em  fleek-demo-docs 
cldda19st0000kz081v8v9esj  fleek-demos-blog
```

Nice, we can see all the sites we have created so far. In future version we should de able to display some extra information on this sites.

## Setting up the CI

Lets go to the `fleek-demos-blog` site and create a new branch called `ci`. This branch will contain the configuration for the CI so we can test it a pull request.

```bash copy
> fleek sites ci
WARN! Fleek CLI is in beta, use it at your own discretion
? Select provider you want to use for building and deploying your sites › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   GitHub Actions - Generator of Github Actions YAML file
```

We can see that we have only one option for now, but in the future we will be adding more options. For now lets select `GitHub Actions`.

```bash copy
? Workflow config will be saved in: /Users/riveign/development/fleek/fleek-demo/fleek-demos-blog/.github/workflows/fleek-deploy.yaml. Would you like to specify a different path? › No / Yes
```

We can see that the file will be saved in the `.github/workflows` folder. This is the default location for github actions. If we want to change the location we can select `Yes` and specify the path. For now lets select `No`.

```bash copy
WARN! Cant find .github/workflows directory.
WARN! Creating .github/workflows directory.
> Success! Github Actions workflow was saved to /Users/riveign/development/fleek/fleek-demo/fleek-demos-blog/.github/workflows/fleek-deploy.yaml file.
> Set following secrets in your Github repository settings:

Name              Value                    
-------------------------------------------
FLEEK_TOKEN       - 
FLEEK_PROJECT_ID  -
```

We can see that the file was created and we have to set some secrets in the github repository settings. Lets go to the github repository settings and add the secrets.

Now lets go back to the terminal and create a pull request.

```bash copy
> git add .
> git commit -m "ci: add ci config"
> git push origin ci
```

Now we can see that the CI is running.

But will it finish?

No because we have not set the install command befopre calling the deploy command. Thus failing when trying to build the site.

Lets add to the `fleek-deploy.yaml` file the following line:

```yaml copy
- name: Install Packages
    run: npm install
```

Now lets commit and push the changes and see the result. Dont worry this flow will be added into the cli in the next version.

Success! The site was deployed to IPFS vis the GHA!
